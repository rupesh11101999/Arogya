# Arogya

Arogya is a web app where users can book an appointment with a doctor for their checkup or for consultation. It will save the time of patients as they no longer have to wait at the OPD waiting room in clinics/hospitals for their turn and also donâ€™t have to go through most of the paperwork.
Using this app, both doctors and patients can keep a record of their past appointments.
